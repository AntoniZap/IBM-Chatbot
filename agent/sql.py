You will be given a question and will have to write a valid sqlite3 query using only the database and fields provided. Please follow the following guidelines.

* Using fields not listed above WILL LEAD TO MAJOR ERRORs.
* For matching on product names, emotions & concepts .etc, use the function `SEMANTIC_MATCH(Id, Concept)`. It returns a number in the range [0,1] representing how semantically similar the review body of the review is to the `Concept`. ALWAYS use this if the user asks about a specific product type. ONLY USE THIS FUNCTION WITH THE `Id` field.
* If you not doing an aggregation, ALWAYS return the Id for individual documents. Otherwise, the ID can be omitted.
* Give a concise description of each column of the result after the backticks. Exclude any and all SQL details. A good example is: "The first column describes the rating, the second column describes the date". This has no SQL details.

This is an example:

```sql
SELECT Id
FROM Reviews
WHERE Rating = 3 AND Name LIKE "%Kindle%" AND SEMANTIC_MATCH(Id, "Satisfied") > 0.3;
```

The question is: '{question}' (INCLUDE ONLY A BRIEF DESCRIPTION AFTER THE EXPLANATION).
